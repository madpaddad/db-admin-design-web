# Learn to CODE

This web project was our first time coding, but we worked on it and learn how to implement it with react. 


# Issue

The UI does not look up to date much but we hope that it stills have an impact on user experience on the good side. 
Our Project was intended to make into 2 types of role but given a short period of time. We couldn't accomplish much. 

# What we learn

We have some basic understanding on component, managing state, and dataflow from api. We hope that this small project will help new coder to understand how software work.

# Getting start:

Before starting our web projct, we had also build an api on db-admin-design-api. We hope that you had finished the api built.

```
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev
```


Thank you for a short visit.
We hope to bring you more future projects.
